title: Everything feels like screaming to a void

I was going to write about how since I left the only social network I actively used, Bluesky, I'm feeling lonely— but if I'm really honest, I don't really feel like writing. Everything in my head now is (still) a depression pit.

Lately I've been trying to find the best medium to vent. I've made a section on my blog called "Status" where it loads posts from Bluesky tagged as microblog with the intention of doing what I was doing with another account but with my main this time, so my moots there can be updated of how I'm going, but it still doesn't feel right.

Not just because Bluesky only has a 300 character limit, but because I can only think of venting, and I don't feel comfortable saying certain things in the open. But I still want to feel heard kind of like a cry for help...? I guess it's pretty ironic. I feel alone and don't want to, but can't help it. I really can't, I don't feel like I have friends or people to share my stuff anymore without feeling I'm bothering everyone because no one really cares.

These last weeks I made quite a bunch of mashups and posted all of them on my Telegram channel, but even though many of my moots follow it and we share a linked discussion group, once again it's like showing them to the void.

Blogs are cool and I love blogging, but at the same time it's once again talking to a void. There's no way to find cool moots with similar interests and there's no proper platform to share a space. Y'all know Bearblog is all about vibes and goodfeel but that's it. The Discover-Trending page is all filled with blogs about blogging and borderline selfhelp stuff, which I don't really vibe with. If I find cool stuff I always send some kind of email to the author; if I know of a collective activity like Bear Blog Carnival, I take the chance to write about that and I really appreciate it, but I don't feel like I connect with anyone. And I doesn't feel the IndieWeb circles out there are any different.

What do I do with my life, really.
